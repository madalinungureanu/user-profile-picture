Users must have the ability to upload images (typically author role or greater). You can use the plugin <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/">Members</a> to allow other roles (e.g. subscribers) the ability to upload images.

A template tag is supplied for outputting to a theme and the option to override a user's default avatar is also available.

== Gutenberg Compatibility ==

As of version 2.0.0, there is a Gutenberg block for outputting to a post.

As of version 2.1.0, the old block is deprecated but still supported. A new block supports themes, more output control, and better style support. You can see an overview in the video below. Sorry about the audio quality.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `metronet-profile-picture` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place `<?php mt_profile_img() ?>` in your templates (arguments and usage are below)

Arguments:

`/**
* mt_profile_img
*
* Adds a profile image
*
@param $user_id INT - The user ID for the user to retrieve the image for
@ param $args mixed
	size - string || array (see get_the_post_thumbnail)
	attr - string || array (see get_the_post_thumbnail)
	echo - bool (true or false) - whether to echo the image or return it
*/
`

Example Usage:
`
<?php
//Assuming $post is in scope
if (function_exists ( 'mt_profile_img' ) ) {
	$author_id=$post->post_author;
	mt_profile_img( $author_id, array(
		'size' => 'thumbnail',
		'attr' => array( 'alt' => 'Alternative Text' ),
		'echo' => true )
	);
}
?>
`

Since 2.2.0, you can add a profile author box using function `mt_author_box`.

`
<?php
mt_author_box( $post->post_author, array(
	'theme'              => 'tabbed',
	'profileAvatarShape' => 'round',
	'showWebsite'        => true,
	'website'            => 'https://www.ronalfy.com',
	'showSocialMedia'    => true,
	'socialMediaOptions' => 'brand',
	'socialWordPress'    => 'https://profiles.wordpress.org/ronalfy',
	'socialFacebook'     => 'https://facebook.com/mindefusement',
) );
`

The REST API is currently supported for versions of WordPress 4.4 and up.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do you set a user profile image? =

1.  Visit the profile page you would like to edit.
2.  Click on the profile picture to add, edit, or remove the profile picture.

= What role does a user have to be to set a profile image? =

Author or greater.

= How do I create specific thumbnail sizes? =

As of 1.5, three image sizes are created: profile_24, profile_48, and profile_96. You are not limited to these sizes, however.

= The image is cropped wrong.  How do I fix this? =

We highly recommend the <a href='http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/post-thumbnail-editor/'>Post Thumbnail Editor</a> plugin for cropping thumbnails, as you can custom-crop various image sizes without affecting other images.

= Does the plugin work with Multisite? =

Yes, but you'll have to set a new profile image per site.  This is currently a limitation of the way the plugin stores its data.  Ideas to overcome this are welcome.
